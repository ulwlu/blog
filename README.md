# ulwlu's blog

ᓚᘏᗢ Just personal daily blog.

Articles about programming can be found on [Qiita](https://qiita.com/ulwlu) and [Zenn](https://zenn.dev/ulwlu).

Mainly launched on netlify, but it deploys on ~~vercel and github-pages~~(I stopped them and left configs) automatically as well.

## history

- 2020-02-14 ~ 2020-12-30     : Sapper, Contentful and Netlify.
- 2020-12-31 ~ Current        : Svelte, Sapper, TypeScript, TailwindCss, PostCSS, Rollup and Netlify.

Actually future repository already exists here.

However, Svelte-kit doesn't have `svelte-kit adapt` completed yet, so can't export now on any platform.
