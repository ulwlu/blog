Still WIP.

The data was wrecked once after about 7 days.

But I'm a programmer, so I fixed it.

I'm glad I was able to tell the author, "Thank you for the wonderful tool, I was able to do what I've wanted to do since I was a kid, thanks to your tool".

I think I'll probably still focus on programming, since the time I can spend on drawing is bottomless.

## Thanks
